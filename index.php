	Well, hello, Dolly

	You're lookin' swell, Dolly
	I can tell, Dolly
	You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
	You're still goin' strong
	We feel the room swayin'
	While the band's playin'
	One of your old favourite songs from way back when
	So, take her wrap, fellas
	Find her an empty lap, fellas
	Dolly'll never go away again
